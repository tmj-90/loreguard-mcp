const HELP = `loreguard — reviewed project memory for AI coding agents

USAGE
  loreguard <command> [options]

COMMANDS
  quickstart                Zero to a working search hit in one command:
                            inits the DB, seeds a demo set if empty, runs
                            a live search, then points you at setup.
  init                      Create / migrate the local DB
  add                       Add a note (human, status=active). Interactive
                            unless --title is given. Refuses records
                            containing a credential-shaped string;
                            override a false positive with --allow-secrets.
  suggest                   Same as add but lands as a draft. Used by agents;
                            also handy when you want to triage later.
  suggest --from-commit <sha>
                            Draft a record straight from a commit message
                            (subject -> title, body -> summary/detail).
                            Auto-derives a commit permalink as the source
                            from remote.origin.url. Lands as a draft;
                            promote via review. --repo/--tag/--source apply.
  search <query...>         Full-text search. Returns brief summaries.
                            Words OR together by default (recall); pass
                            --all to require every word (precision), or
                            "quote a phrase" to match adjacent words.
                            Flags: --repo, --tag (repeatable for ANY-of),
                            --all (AND instead of OR), --prefix (match
                            tokens of 3+ chars as prefixes),
                            --updated-after, --include-drafts,
                            --include-deprecated, --include-superseded,
                            --include-restricted, --limit
  show <id>                 Print the full record (body included).
  list                      Recent records across all lifecycle states.
  review [--list]           Interactive triage queue: show each pending
                            draft and ask [a]pprove / [r]eject / [e]dit /
                            [s]kip / [q]uit. Use --list (or pipe to stdout)
                            for the non-interactive list view.
  approve <id>              Promote draft → active.
  reject <id> [--reason "..."]
                            Drop a draft. Refuses non-drafts (use
                            deprecate instead). Emits a 'rejected' event
                            so the audit chain shows the triage decision.
                            --reason is optional but recommended — gives
                            the agent (or future-you) a record of WHY
                            the draft was dropped.
  deprecate <id>            Mark deprecated.
  supersede <old-id> --with <new-id>
                            Mark <old-id> as superseded by <new-id>.
  verify <id> [--review-after <iso-date>]
                            Bump last_verified_at; if review-after has
                            lapsed, push it 90 days forward (or use the
                            value you pass with --review-after).
  update <id> [--title ... --summary ... --body ... --source ... etc.]
                            Edit fields on an existing record. Useful
                            for fixing an agent's draft before approving.
  delete <id>               Hard-delete the record (events row preserved).
  tags                      List tags with record counts; flags likely
                            typo'd near-duplicates. Subcommands:
                            tags rename <from> <to>,
                            tags merge <from...> <into>.
  repos                     Print all distinct repos.
  export [--out <path>] [--html]
                            Export lore as a single JSON document
                            (envelope: { schemaVersion, exportedAt,
                            records }). Default: active + non-restricted
                            only, stable ordering by updated_at desc.
                            Without --out, writes to stdout. With --out,
                            writes the file with mode 0600.
                            --html instead writes a self-contained,
                            offline HTML page (records + architecture
                            graph) you can commit or publish — no server,
                            no network, restricted records excluded.
                            Opt-ins: --include-drafts,
                            --include-deprecated, --include-superseded,
                            --include-restricted.
  sync export <dir> [--clean]
                            Write one .md file per record into <dir>
                            (e.g. .loreguard/) — PR-reviewable team lore.
                            Active + non-restricted by default; same
                            --include-* opt-ins as \`export\`. Pass --clean
                            to remove existing <id>.md files in <dir>
                            before writing (only files matching the
                            8-char id pattern; hand-written .md files
                            are left alone).
  sync import <dir>         Read every *.md file in <dir> and upsert
                            into the local DB. Restricted records are
                            skipped unless --include-restricted is set.
                            Imports respect the file's declared status
                            (the PR is the review gate).
  sync pull <parent>        Recursively discover every .loreguard/
                            directory under <parent> and import each.
                            One command bootstraps a fresh machine
                            across every repo in your workspace tree.
                            Same flags as \`sync import\`. Skips heavy
                            directories (node_modules, .git, dist,
                            build, target, vendor, etc.).
  audit [--n=N] [--raw]     Print the last N audit log lines (default 20)
                            in a redacted human-readable form. Use --raw
                            to see the full JSON instead.
  doctor                    Health-check the local install: DB exists,
                            permissions, FTS index, audit log, restricted
                            MCP gate, version. Exits non-zero on hard
                            failures, zero on warnings.
  setup [--dry-run] [--force] [--claude-md project|user]
                            One-command bootstrap: register the MCP server
                            with Claude Code, append the retrieval rule to
                            CLAUDE.md, install /loreguard-onboard into
                            ~/.claude/skills/, and point you at
                            /loreguard-onboard for cold-start (detects
                            CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, ADR dirs, top-level docs
                            to make the nudge concrete).
                            Idempotent. Opt out per step with --skip-mcp,
                            --skip-claude-md, --skip-skill,
                            --skip-corpus-nudge.
  demo [--force | --clean]  Seed five illustrative records (tagged 'demo')
                            so you can try list / search / review without
                            authoring content first. Refuses to seed into
                            a non-empty DB unless --force. Use --clean to
                            remove the demo records later.
  absent record "<query>" --reason "..." [--repo X] [--expires-days 14]
                            Record a verified-absence marker: "we
                            checked, the team has no policy on this".
                            When future search_lore returns zero hits
                            on the same normalised query, the response
                            includes this marker so the agent knows
                            it's an acknowledged gap. Self-expires
                            (default 14 days).
  absent list [--include-expired]
                            List active absence markers (or all of
                            them with --include-expired).
  stats [--top N] [--retire] [--since-days N] [--quiet-for-days N] [--json]
                            Local read-tracking view: top-cited
                            records, retirement candidates (active +
                            zero reads in N days), recent activity.
                            Opt out of read tracking via
                            LOREGUARD_NO_TELEMETRY=1.
  digest [--quiet-for-days N] [--json]
                            "What needs a human decision?" roll-up:
                            open conflicts, pending drafts, stale
                            active records, retirement candidates, and
                            pending boundary edges in one list.
  prune [--read-events-older-than N] [--vacuum] [--dry-run]
                            Local-DB GC. Deletes 'read' audit events
                            older than N days (default 90; lifecycle
                            events are never touched) and expired
                            absence markers. --vacuum reclaims disk
                            after; --dry-run reports counts only.
  impact <contract>         Cross-repo impact map for a contract: who
                            PROVIDES (owns/produces) it and who CONSUMES
                            (depends on) it. The consumers are the blast
                            radius of a shape change. Reads the map
                            aggregated locally + via sync pull.
  graph [<repo>] [--gaps] [--manifest] [--out F] [--json] [--include-drafts]
                            Repo-level architecture graph from boundary
                            edges. No arg: the whole dependency map. With
                            a repo: its full multi-hop upstream (what it
                            depends on) and downstream (the blast radius).
                            --gaps: contracts consumed with no provider
                            (and provided with no consumer) — map holes.
                            --manifest: a deterministic, timestamp-free
                            JSON snapshot to commit (e.g.
                            .loreguard/architecture.json) so architecture
                            drift shows up as a PR diff.
  discover [<path>] [--repo N] [--write] [--json]
                            Scan source for contract signals (HTTP routes,
                            pub/sub topics, queue consumers) and propose
                            boundary edges. Dry-run by default; --write
                            adds them as DRAFTS for 'boundary review'.
  boundary <sub> ...        Manage cross-repo interaction edges:
                            add <repo> <contract> <provides|consumes>

                            suggest ...   (same, lands as a draft)
                            list [--repo X --contract C --role R
                              --include-drafts --include-deprecated]
                            review [--list]   triage draft edges
                            approve <id> | reject <id> | deprecate <id>
                            Agents declare edges as drafts via MCP; a
                            human ratifies them — same trust gate as lore.
  hooks install [--project] [--dry-run]
                            Wire the Claude Code Stop-hook for
                            session-end review nudges. Writes
                            .claude/settings.json so when Claude is
                            about to stop, the hook checks for pending
                            drafts and (once per session) asks the
                            user whether to triage them. Opt-in.
  hooks review-nudge        Internal — invoked by the Stop hook.
                            Reads Claude hook JSON on stdin; emits
                            block-JSON to stdout when drafts are
                            pending and this session hasn't been
                            nudged yet.
  print-claude-instructions
                            Print the retrieval rule to paste into
                            your CLAUDE.md / agent instructions so the
                            agent reliably calls search_lore.
                            --format claude|cursor|windsurf|generic
                            tailors it (cursor emits a .mdc rule file).
  mcp                       Run the MCP server on stdio (same as loreguard-mcp).
